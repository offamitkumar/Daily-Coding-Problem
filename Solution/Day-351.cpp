This seems a Neural Language Processing problem.

The general idea to solve this problem is, to create vector for each of the word , let's just say 
our attributes are : name , height , nature , color , age 
then these attributes have different value for a person , country , material. So by supervised or un-supervised 
learning we can prepare the model and predict the output. 

solving this problem is somewhat creating a whole new project, so let's just skip this one.
